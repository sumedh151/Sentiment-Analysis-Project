# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
This is a project from a course on how to build a neural network to predict sentiment, positive or negative in movie reviews. The course was lectured by Andrew Trask, a PhD student at the university of Oxford and author of the book Grokking Deep Learning, in the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation from Udacity.
